\section{Introduction}
Programming languages such as Scala, Kotlin, C\#, and Swift are adopting
type systems that track whether a reference may be null. An
important concern in such languages is interfacing with existing code in
a language that does not track nullability in types, such as an older
version of the same language, or a different language such as Java or C.

Gradual typing~\cite{siek2006gradual} is a general framework that
enables to reason soundly about the interface between program
components written in languages with different type systems.
\citet{DBLP:conf/ecoop/NietoRRL19} applied gradual typing to the
case of type systems that track null references.

\TODO{more details about why the system in that paper is complicated}
- three function types
- casts as values
- weird cast reduction relation

\TODO{explain our improvement over that paper}
- just a nullable type D?
- Tangram lemma
