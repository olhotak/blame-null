\section{An Implicitly Nullable Language}

\input{fig/impsyntax}

\Cref{fig:imptyping} shows the typing rules for the implicit terms.
The typing rules for explicit terms are the same as for the basic calculus in \Cref{fig:typing},
except the \rn{Blame} rule is removed, a new rule for embedded implicit terms is added, and the \rn{Cast} rule is restricted to subtypes as shown
in \Cref{fig:imptyping}.
