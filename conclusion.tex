\section{Conclusion}

We have defined a pair of core calculi for modelling interoperability
between languages that track null references explicitly in their type
systems and ones that do not. Our definitions follow the standard
blame calculus of \citet{DBLP:conf/esop/WadlerF09}; in particular,
their Tangram Lemma approach can be used to assign blame for
cast failures to the less precise language whose type system
ignores nullability. These core calculi can serve as a basis for
modelling nullness interoperability in larger languages.
Our development is formalized in Coq, and we will
submit the formalization to the OOPSLA Artifact Evaluation process.
